Photographers and any user seeking a solution for macOS to visualize images in Windows style.

Picview is an image viewer for macOS with a nice minimal modern user interface. Picview works great with JPEG, HEIC, PSD, RAW, WEBP, PNG, GIF, and many other formats. Provides basic image processing, including flip and rotate, EXIF, and other information. Supports keyboard shortcuts and trackpad gestures. The most important, Picview like Windows' default picture viewer — Photos, where zoom in and out with the mouse wheel and switch between images with arrow keys and/or with on-screen buttons.
